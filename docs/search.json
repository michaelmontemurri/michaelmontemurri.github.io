    "text": "About Me\nI am a graduate student at McGill University and Mila – Quebec AI Institute, pursuing an M.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics under the supervision of Prof. Eric Kolaczyk.\nMy research focuses on interpretable graph representation learning for molecular property prediction in low-data regimes, combining deep graph models with tree-based methods to improve generalization and reduce variance in graph-level prediction tasks. I also study pretraining strategies for graph neural networks and graph transformers, and am broadly interested in generative modeling for molecular design and drug discovery.\nI hold a B.Sc. in Physics and Applied Mathematics from Bowling Green State University, where I was a member of the NCAA Division I Men’s Soccer Team and a Research Assistant in the Zamkov Lab, studying quantum dots.\nBefore graduate school, I worked as a Data Scientist in South Essex Fabricating’s R&D Division.\nIn the Summer of 2025, I joined Morgan Stanley as a Quantitative Strategist Summer Associate on the U.S. Treasuries desk.\nView my CV (PDF)"
