    "text": "About Me\nI am a graduate student at McGill University and Mila – Quebec AI Institute, pursuing an M.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics under the supervision of Prof. Eric Kolaczyk. My research focuses on graph-embedded random forests and graph representation learning for interpretable molecular property prediction in low-data regimes.\nI earned my B.Sc. in Physics and Applied Mathematics from Bowling Green State University in 2023, graduating Summa Cum Laude while competing on the NCAA Division I Men’s Soccer team. During my undergraduate studies, I worked in the Zamkov Lab, researching colloidal quantum dots for photovoltaic applications, and in the Nardone Research Group, where I simulated and investigated photovoltaic devices.\nMost recently, I worked as a data scientist at South Essex Fabricating’s Research and Development Division, where I developed machine learning models for crop yield forecasting and built computer vision systems for automated crop sampling.\nIn the Summer of 2025, I’ll be joining Morgan Stanley in Montreal as a Quant Strats Summer Associate in the Fixed Income Division.\nView my CV as PDF"
