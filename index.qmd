## About Me

I am a graduate student at McGill University and Mila – Quebec AI Institute, pursuing an M.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics under the supervision of [Prof. Eric Kolaczyk](https://kolaczyk.github.io/).  

My research focuses on interpretable **graph representation learning** for molecular property prediction in low-data regimes, combining deep graph models with tree-based methods to improve generalization and reduce variance in graph-level prediction tasks.
I also study **pretraining strategies for graph neural networks and graph transformers**, and am broadly interested in **generative modeling for molecular design and drug discovery**.

I hold a B.Sc. in Physics and Applied Mathematics from Bowling Green State University, where I was a member of the NCAA Division I Men’s Soccer Team and a Research Assistant in the [Zamkov Lab](https://physics.bgsu.edu/~zamkovm/), studying quantum dots.

Before graduate school, I worked as a Data Scientist in South Essex Fabricating’s R&D Division.

In the Summer of 2025, I joined Morgan Stanley as a Quantitative Strategist Summer Associate on the U.S. Treasuries desk.
