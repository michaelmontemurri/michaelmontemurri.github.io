## About Me

I am a graduate student at McGill University and Mila – Quebec AI Institute, pursuing an M.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics under the supervision of [Prof. Eric Kolaczyk](https://sites.bu.edu/kolaczyk/). My research focuses on graph-embedded random forests and graph representation learning for interpretable molecular property prediction in low-data regimes.

I earned my B.Sc. in Physics and Applied Mathematics from Bowling Green State University in 2023, graduating *Summa Cum Laude* while competing on the NCAA Division I Men’s Soccer team. During my undergraduate studies, I worked in the Zamkov Lab, researching colloidal quantum dots for photovoltaic applications, and in the Nardone Research Group, where I simulated and investigated photovoltaic devices.

Most recently, I worked as a data scientist at South Essex Fabricating’s Research and Development Division, where I developed machine learning models for crop yield forecasting and built computer vision systems for automated crop sampling.

In the Summer of 2025, I'll be joining Morgan Stanley in Montreal as a Quant Strats Summer Associate in the Fixed Income Division.
