## About Me

I am a graduate student at McGill University and Mila – Quebec AI Institute, pursuing an M.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics under the supervision of [Prof. Eric Kolaczyk](https://sites.bu.edu/kolaczyk/). My research focuses on graph-embedded random forests and graph representation learning for interpretable molecular property prediction in low-data regimes.

I earned my B.Sc. in Physics and Applied Mathematics from Bowling Green State University in 2023 while competing on the NCAA Division I Men’s Soccer team. During my undergraduate studies, I worked in the Zamkov Lab, researching colloidal quantum dots for photovoltaic applications.

Prior to starting my graduate studies, I worked as a Data Scientist at South Essex Fabricating’s Research and Development Division.

Most recently, I interned as a Quantitative Strategist Summer Associate at Morgan Stanley in their Fixed Income Division.
